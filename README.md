## Introduction
This document provides an in-depth exploration of OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)-based communication systems. It focuses on modeling, characterization, and various dualities that emerge when studying wireless channels. The study is structured to cover both the theoretical and practical aspects of OFDM, including simulations and implementations in wideband and MIMO scenarios.
